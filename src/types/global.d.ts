// This declaration helps TypeScript recognize PrismaClient if it's having trouble
// finding the generated types, especially after a fresh install or rebuild.
// The ideal solution is for `prisma generate` to run successfully and for
// TypeScript to correctly pick up the generated types from `node_modules/.prisma/client`.
